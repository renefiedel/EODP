	libgeotiff Licensing
	====================

All the source code in this toolkit are either in the public domain, or under 
an X style license.  In any event it is all considered to be free to use
for any purpose (including commercial software).  No credit is required 
though some of the code requires that the specific source code modules 
retain their existing copyright statements.  The CSV files, and other tables
derived from the EPSG coordinate system database are also free to use.  In 
particular, no part of this code is "copyleft", nor does it imply any 
requirement for users to disclose this or their own source code.

All components not carrying their own copyright message, but distributed
with libgeotiff should be considered to be under the same license as
Niles' code.

The EPSG Tables (from which the CSV files, and .inc files are derived)
carried this statement on use of the data (from the EPSG web site):

Use of the Data

The user assumes the entire risk as to the accuracy and the use of this 
data. The data may be used, copied and distributed subject to the following 
conditions:

1. INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THIS DOCUMENT IS PROVIDED "AS IS"
   WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
   INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY AND/OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

2. The data may be included in any commercial package provided that any 
   commerciality is based on value added by the provider and not on a value 
   ascribed to the EPSG dataset which is made available at no charge. The 
   ownership of the EPSG dataset [OGP] must be acknowledged.


3. Subsets of information may be extracted from the dataset. Users are 
   advised that coordinate reference system and coordinate transformation 
   descriptions are incomplete unless all elements detailed as essential 
   in OGP Surveying and Positioning Guidance Note 7-1 annex F are included.

4. Essential elements should preferably be reproduced as described in the 
   dataset.  Modification of parameter values is permitted as described in 
   the table below to allow change to the content of the information provided 
   that numeric equivalence is achieved.  Numeric equivalence refers to the 
   results of geodetic calculations in which the parameters are used, for 
   example (i) conversion of ellipsoid defining parameters, or (ii) conversion 
   of parameters between one and two standard parallel projection methods, 
   or (iii) conversion of parameters between 7-parameter geocentric 
   transformation methods.

   (EPSG provides a table at this point with some details)

5. No data that has been modified other than as permitted in these terms 
   and conditions shall be described as or attributed to the EPSG dataset.

proj Library

Terms and conditions are stated at the following URL: http://trac.osgeo.org/proj
The source code can be downloaded at: http://download.osgeo.org/proj/
The Library is provided under the following terms and conditions:

All source, data files and other contents of the PROJ.4 package are 
available under the following terms.  Note that the PROJ 4.3 and earlier
was "public domain" as is common with US government work, but apparently
this is not a well defined legal term in many countries.  I am placing 
everything under the following MIT style license because I believe it is
effectively the same as public domain, allowing anyone to use the code as
they wish, including making proprietary derivatives. 

Though I have put my own name as copyright holder, I don't mean to imply
I did the work.  Essentially all work was done by Gerald Evenden.
